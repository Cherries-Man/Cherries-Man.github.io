# The Blog only for My Life

Cherries Man, a CUGer, undergrate of CS and a lifelong learner. People need to work, study and struggle, but they also need to live, to think and to relax. So this website is a spiritual post that only for life. If you are interested in my technology learning, please go to my CSDN blog: https://blog.csdn.net/myf_666.
